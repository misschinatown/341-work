<h1> Nothing Gold Can Stay </h1>
<h2> by Robert Frost </h2>
<p> Nature's first green is gold, <br />
  Her harderst hue to hold. <br />
  Her early leaf's a flower; <br />
  But only so an hour. <br />
  Then leaf subsides to leaf. <br />
  So Eden sank to grief, <br />
  So dawn does down to day. <br />
  Nothing gold can stay. <br/> </p>
